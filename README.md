THE PIECE:

The viewer will be in a room, standing inside a square marked on the floor (around 10 feet on each side). In front of the viewer will a be screen, as well as music playing from speakers.
The image projected onto the screen and the music playing will be determined by the position of the viewer within the box. Beginning from the bottom left corner, the screen will show images & clips from a certain historical time period, and the music will play songs from the same period. As the viewer moves towards the right side of the box, the images on the screen will advance the time period, so that the standing on the right side of the screen shows modern clips and music.

Therefore, moving right and left across the room will allow the user to control the time period of the display.
In addition, moving towards the top of the square will show different images/music from that same time period, to similate the idea of moving through space.
Ultimately, the piece will allow viewers to control the space and time of the room, through the use of visual and auditory experiences.

Iâ€™ve chosen American Popular culture as the theme of the images/display, in order to appeal to a wider audience as well as explore the relationship and progress of American culture and history across time.

THE TECH:
The piece will be setup in an empty room, with a square drawn on the floor using tape. The front of the room will have a screen with a projecter connected to a computer.

The position of the viewer will be tracked with a camera that uses the X and Y position of the viewer within the square to alter the images/music. Either one camera will be mounted on the ceiling to track both X and Y position, or two cameras can be placed on front (X position) and right (Y position) of the room.

The piece will be created using Max 7, utilizing the MSP, Jitter, and OpenCV libraries for audio, visual, and camera tracking, respectively.
